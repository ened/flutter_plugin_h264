# h264

A simple Flutter plugin which decodes raw h264 IDR frames into bitmap representations.

The plugin utilizes platform code and does not depend on 3rd party libraries.

## Open issues

- [ ] iOS Support
- [ ] Customize output format
- [ ] Import a lot more sample files for validation (generate them through ffmpeg perhaps)
- [ ] Reduce Android API level requirements to 16+ (currently 21+ due to modern API usage)
